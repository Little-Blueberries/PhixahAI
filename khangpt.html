                        Contest: AI
                
            I have completed 100% of Khan Academy's 
        'Intro to HTML/CSS' and have been programming 
                    for 8 months.
    
              I would prefer to be placed in the
                         [Intermediate]
                            Bracket
                        
 In creating this entry, I focused on making an AI chat bot that functions similar to ChatGPT and other in real life AIs. I also got ChaGpt suggested responses to ensure the best "AI" sounding bot KhanGpt could ever be.
                                
  One aspect I found challenging was to make enough responses that would make the AI bot say certain things related to what was sent when interacting with it.
                                
                   I would like to highlight
   this is my first time participating in a contest and I learned many text functions and how to make a gradiant background. Hope you enjoy my entry, and good luck to all of the other contestants!
